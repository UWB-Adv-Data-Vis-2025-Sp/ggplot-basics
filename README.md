# ggplot-basics
Basic graphs in ggplot.

For this assignment you will complete code to build commonly encountered plots including scatter plots, column plots, and box plots.

Before beginning the assignment, read the following chapters from https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html:

0. Welcome
1. Introduction https://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html
2. Explore: Introduction https://r4ds.had.co.nz/explore-intro.html
3. Explore: Data visualization https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html

If this is your first time working with R code or need some extra help recalling how it works, I recommend using the following materials:

- learnr: an r studio package that shows some of the basics of working with R and R studio. https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/index.html 
- Get Started from *Data Visualization* by Healy https://socviz.co/gettingstarted.html#gettingstarted

For this assignment, complete the task for the below sections. You'll want to first make sure you have installed the required packages that are in the setup chunk. As you update your code to create ggplots, you can run individual chunks using the green play button in the upper right corner of the chunk. This helps you see the products of your code before knitting the full document.

As you complete each section, write a commit message. When you are finish, push the code to github and complete the assignment by submitting a pull request.
